# ActionNetworkAPIPython
Uses Python to download Action Network data via the REST API and upload it to ?.

please note: this uses the API access, not the SQL Mirror. You will need your API key. (Settings->API & Sync)

I'll start off with a postgres upload. Interested in what the community want for ease of use of the data.

to-do
I have to do the upload to postgres bit
I could make it read/write for the fields that are read/write
I should make the download only do it from the last download date

but hey, I'm pleased with this.
